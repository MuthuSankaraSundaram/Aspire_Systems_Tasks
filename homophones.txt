Dear Omar,

I hope you are doing well.
I'm not feeling well today as I have caught the flu, and my condition isnâ€™t good.Nancy will follow up with my 
clients, and Sam will complete the report for our meeting on Friday. The report will include the sales figures 
from the last quarter, as you requested.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Yours sincerely,
Muthu Sankara Sundaram K
